This is available for everywhere excluding NT & NSW.\n</p>\n<p>\nNational Shelter, Community Sector Banking and SGS Economics and Planning have released the Rental Affordability Index (RAI) on a biannual basis since 2015. A price index for rental housing markets, the RAI is an easy to understand indicator of rental affordability relative to household incomes. It is applied to geographic areas across Australia.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is generally accepted that if housing costs exceed 30% of a low income household?s (households with the lowest 40% of income) gross income, then that household is experiencing housing stress (30/40 rule). In the RAI, households who are paying 30% of income on rent have a score of 100, indicating that these households are at the critical threshold for housing stress. A score of 100 or less indicates that households would pay more than 30% of income to access a rental dwelling, meaning they are at risk of experiencing housing stress.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe RAI is calculated using the following equation, where ?qualifying income? refers to the household income required to pay rent where rent is equal to 30% of income.\n</p>\n<br/>Wherever the value of an attribute was NA in the original data, it appears here as NULL.<br/>\n<p>\nRAI = (Median income ? Qualifying Income) x 100\n</p>\n<p>\nFor more information on the Rental Affordability Index and to access key findings reports, visit: <a href=https://www.sgsep.com.au/maps/thirdspace/australia-rental-affordability-index target='_blank'>www.sgsep.com.au</a>\n</p>","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"unique_id","type":"java.lang.String","title":"Unique Identifier","description":"Unique identifier.","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"wkb_geometry","type":"com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.Geometry","title":"Geometry Field","description":"Geometry field.","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"rai_national_total_2017_q1","type":"java.lang.Double","title":"First Quarter 2017, National Rental Affordability Index Total","description":"First Quarter 2017, National Rental Affordability Index Total.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"rai_national_total_2017_q2","type":"java.lang.Double","title":"Second Quarter 2017, National Rental Affordability Index Total","description":"Second Quarter 2017, National Rental Affordability Index Total.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"geography_name","type":"java.lang.String","title":"Geography Name","description":"ABS geography name for the sptial unit being used (i.e. For postcodes, this will be the same as Geography_Code.
